practice!
Hello! I'm Shannon. I'm a stay at home mom to four kiddos. I'm an author, but obviously not a big deal. My husband recently lost his job which is why I've been trying to find new ways to get a new job with low funds which is how I found Code: You Kentucky. Code: You seemed perfect for me and I was really excited to start and was shocked when I got the email. This is a while new language--for real!
